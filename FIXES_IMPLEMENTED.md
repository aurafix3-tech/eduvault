# EduVault Fixes Implemented

## 🔧 **Issues Fixed:**

### 1. **Authentication Token Persistence Issue**
**Problem**: Users were being redirected to login page on refresh
**Solution**: 
- Improved error handling in AuthContext for both admin and super-admin frontends
- Only fail authentication on actual 401 errors, not network issues
- Better token persistence logic

**Files Modified**:
- `admin-frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.js`
- `super-admin-frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.js`

### 2. **CAT/Exam Storage Issue**
**Problem**: CATs and Exams were not being properly saved or retrieved
**Solutions**:

#### A. **Backend - New Admin Assessments Endpoint**
- Created `/api/admin/assessments` endpoint
- Fetches all assessments uploaded by the current admin
- Filters by `uploadedBy` field to show only admin's content
- Returns proper status (pending/approved/rejected)

**File**: `server/routes/admin.js`

#### B. **Frontend - Proper Data Fetching**
- Added `fetchAssessments()` function to get data from server
- Replaced local state management with server-side data
- Refresh assessments list after successful upload
- Removed mock data dependency

**File**: `admin-frontend/src/components/Admin/CATsExamsManagement.js`

### 3. **Content Approval Workflow**
**Problem**: Uploaded CATs not appearing in super admin approval queue
**Solutions**:

#### A. **Enhanced Debugging**
- Added comprehensive logging to content approval endpoint
- Created debug endpoints for testing:
  - `/api/debug/content` - View all content in database
  - `/api/debug/pending` - Check pending approval queue
  - `/api/content-approval/pending-debug` - Test approval endpoint without auth

#### B. **Improved Upload Logging**
- Enhanced assessment upload endpoint with detailed logging
- Shows assessment details after successful save
- Tracks upload progress and errors

**Files**: 
- `server/routes/contentApproval.js`
- `server/routes/upload.js`
- `server/routes/debugContent.js`

### 4. **Secure Image Viewing**
**Previous Fix**: Fixed route precedence issue where secure images weren't loading
- Moved `/api/secure-images` route before `/api` catch-all route
- Added comprehensive fallbacks and debugging

## 🔍 **Testing Instructions:**

### **For CAT Upload & Approval:**

1. **Upload CAT as Mini Admin**:
   ```
   Login: admin@eduvault.co.ke / miniadmin123
   Go to: Admin Dashboard → CATs & Exams Management
   Upload a CAT with image file
   ```

2. **Verify CAT was Saved**:
   ```
   Visit: http://localhost:5001/api/debug/content
   Look for your CAT with status: "pending"
   ```

3. **Check Super Admin Approval Queue**:
   ```
   Login: superadmin@eduvault.co.ke / admin123
   Go to: Super Admin Dashboard → Content Approval
   Your CAT should appear in pending list
   ```

4. **Approve CAT**:
   ```
   Click approve in super admin dashboard
   CAT status changes to "approved"
   ```

5. **Verify Student Access**:
   ```
   Login as student
   Go to course page where CAT was uploaded
   CAT should appear with "View Secure" button
   ```

### **For Authentication Issues:**

1. **Test Token Persistence**:
   ```
   Login to admin/super-admin dashboard
   Refresh the page
   Should stay logged in (not redirect to login)
   ```

2. **Check Server Logs**:
   ```
   Look for authentication logs in server console
   Should see successful auth checks, not failures
   ```

## 🚀 **Expected Results:**

### ✅ **Authentication Fixed**:
- No more redirects to login page on refresh
- Tokens persist properly across sessions
- Better error handling for network issues

### ✅ **CAT Storage Fixed**:
- CATs are properly saved to database with `status: 'pending'`
- Mini admin can see their uploaded CATs after refresh
- CATs appear in super admin approval queue

### ✅ **Content Approval Fixed**:
- Super admin can see all pending content
- Approval/rejection workflow works properly
- Approved content appears for students

### ✅ **Secure Viewing Fixed**:
- Students can view approved CATs/exams securely
- Screenshot/recording prevention active
- Proper security measures in place

## 🔧 **Debug Endpoints Available:**

1. **`GET /api/debug/content`** - View all content in database
2. **`GET /api/debug/pending`** - Check pending approval queue  
3. **`GET /api/content-approval/pending-debug`** - Test approval endpoint
4. **`GET /api/admin/assessments`** - Get admin's uploaded assessments

## 📊 **Server Logs to Watch:**

When uploading CAT:
```
✅ CAT assessment saved successfully
📊 Course: [Course Name], Unit: [Unit Name]
👤 Uploaded by: [Admin Name]
🔍 Assessment details: { assessmentId: ..., title: ..., status: 'pending' }
```

When checking approval queue:
```
🔍 Content approval: Fetching courses for super admin...
📊 Found courses: X
🔍 Checking assessments for unit: [Unit Name]
📋 cats details: [{ id: ..., title: ..., status: "pending" }]
```

## 🎯 **Next Steps:**

1. Test the complete workflow end-to-end
2. Upload a CAT as mini admin
3. Verify it appears in super admin approval queue
4. Approve it and check student access
5. Test secure viewing functionality

The system should now work properly without authentication issues or content storage problems!
