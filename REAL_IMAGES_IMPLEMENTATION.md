# Real Images Implementation for CATs and Exams

## 🔧 **Changes Made:**

### **1. Removed Placeholder System**
**Before**: Always served placeholder SVG images
**After**: Serves actual uploaded assessment files from database

### **2. Enhanced Secure Images Endpoint**
**File**: `server/routes/secureImages.js`

#### **Image Serving (`GET /:type/:id`)**:
- ✅ **Database Lookup**: Finds actual assessment in Course.units.assessments
- ✅ **File Validation**: Checks if uploaded file exists on server
- ✅ **Security Check**: Only serves approved assessments
- ✅ **Content Type**: Automatically detects file type (JPG, PNG, GIF, SVG, PDF, WebP)
- ✅ **Security Headers**: Prevents caching, downloading, and external access
- ✅ **Fallback**: Shows placeholder only if real file is missing

#### **Metadata Endpoint (`GET /metadata/:type/:id`)**:
- ✅ **Real Data**: Returns actual assessment information from database
- ✅ **Course Info**: Shows real course name, code, and institution
- ✅ **Unit Details**: Displays actual unit name, year, and semester
- ✅ **Assessment Data**: Real title, description, marks, duration, instructions
- ✅ **File Info**: Actual file type and availability status

### **3. Supported File Types**
- **Images**: JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF, SVG, WebP
- **Documents**: PDF
- **Auto-detection**: Based on file extension
- **Proper MIME types**: Correct Content-Type headers

### **4. Security Features Maintained**
- ✅ **Authentication Required**: Only logged-in users can access
- ✅ **Approval Check**: Only approved assessments are served
- ✅ **No Caching**: Prevents browser/proxy caching
- ✅ **No Downloads**: Blocks direct file downloads
- ✅ **Screenshot Prevention**: All existing security measures active
- ✅ **Audit Logging**: Tracks all access attempts

## 🔍 **How It Works:**

### **1. Upload Process**:
```
Mini Admin uploads CAT → File saved to /uploads/assessments/ → Database record created with filename
```

### **2. Approval Process**:
```
Super Admin approves → Assessment status changes to 'approved' → Becomes available to students
```

### **3. Viewing Process**:
```
Student clicks "View Secure" → SecureImageViewer opens → Fetches real metadata → Loads actual image file
```

### **4. File Path Structure**:
```
server/uploads/assessments/
├── assessment-1234567890-image.jpg
├── cat-9876543210-question.png
└── exam-5555555555-paper.pdf
```

## 🚀 **Expected Results:**

### **✅ For Students**:
- See actual uploaded CAT/exam images instead of placeholders
- Real assessment titles, descriptions, and instructions
- Proper course and unit information displayed
- Actual due dates and time limits
- All security features still active

### **✅ For Admins**:
- Uploaded files are properly stored and retrievable
- Real assessment data appears in approval queue
- File validation ensures only valid uploads are accepted
- Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

### **✅ For System**:
- Proper file type detection and serving
- Security headers prevent unauthorized access
- Database integrity maintained
- Fallback to placeholder if file missing
